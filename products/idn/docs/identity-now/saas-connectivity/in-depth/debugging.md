## Debug locally

An easy way to debug locally is to use `console.log()` to print debug
information to your console. You can add `console.log()` statements anywhere,
and the messages they print can contain static text or variables. For example,
to see the contents of an input object when you are invoking the
`stdAccountCreate` command, you can craft the following debug logic:

```javascript
export const connector = async () => {
  return createConnector().stdAccountCreate(
    async (
      context: Context,
      input: StdAccountCreateInput,
      res: Response<StdAccountCreateOutput>
    ) => {
      // Print the contents of input to the console.  Must use
      // JSON.stringify() to print the contents of an object.
      console.log(
        `Input received for account create: ${JSON.stringify(input)}`
      );
      if (!input.attributes.id) {
        throw new ConnectorError("identity cannot be null");
      }
      const user = await airtable.createAccount(input);
      logger.info(user, "created user in Airtable");
      res.send(user.toStdAccountCreateOutput());
    }
  );
};
```

`console.log()` statements work anywhere, and they work when you deploy your
connector to IDN. However, these statements can create clutter in your code. You
will often have to clean up debug statements once you are done.

If your IDE supports debugging JavaScript, then your IDEâ€™s built-in debugger can
be a powerful and easy way to debug your code.

## Debug in VS Code

### Debug through the javascript debug terminal

In VS Code, open a javascript debug terminal window and run the npm run dev
command.

`npm run dev`

Now you can set breakpoints in your typescript files in VS Code:

### Debug through the VS Code Debug configuration

To simplify the debugging process, you can consolidate the debugging steps into
a VS Code launch configuration. The following snippet is an example of how you
would do so:

**Launch.json:**

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch Program via NPM",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeArgs": ["run-script", "dev"],
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "npm.cmd"
      },
      "linux": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "npm"
      },
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "type": "node"
    }
  ]
}
```

With these configurations set, you can run the debugger by selecting the options
shown in the following image:

## Debug in IdentityNow

You can use the `sail conn logs` command to gain insight into how your connector
is performing while running in IDN. See the section on logging for more
information.
