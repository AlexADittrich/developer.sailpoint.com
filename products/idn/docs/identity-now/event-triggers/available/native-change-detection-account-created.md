## Event Context

:::caution Important Setup

You must have at least one source configured for Native Change Detection (NCD) before you will receive events from this trigger.  There are two ways you can configure a source for NCD:

1. Invoke the [update native change detection configuration](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/put-native-change-detection-config) for each source you want to receive events for NCD.
2. Configure the NCD options on the source in the source configuration UI.

:::

Native Change Detection (NCD) events occur when a source account is changed directly on the source as opposed to changing as the result of a provisioning action initiated by SailPoint.  This trigger fires an event when an account is **created** directly on the target source rather than from a provisioning activity by SailPoint.

<div align="center">

    C -->|yes| D[Trigger Source Account Created event]
    C -->|no| E[Trigger Native Change Detection\nAccount Created event]
```

</div>

This event trigger can be used to immediately notify interested parties and remediate accounts that are created directly on the source.  Some examples of how this trigger can be used are as follows:

- Notify the identity's manager and the source owner of the new account
- Create a micro-certification for the identity to review their new account access
- Automatically disable or lock accounts created directly on a source

This is an example input from this trigger:

```

- `identity` The identity correlated to this account.
- `singleValueAttributeChanges` Contains a list of account attributes that have changed.  During an account created event, all aggregated account attributes will be listed, and their `oldValue` will be null.
- `entitlementChanges` Contains a list of entitlements that have been aggregated with the account.  the `removed` list will always be empty for an account created event.
- `eventType` Will always be `ACCOUNT_CREATED` for account created events.
- `source` The source where this account originated from.
- `accountChangeTypes` A list of change types you can expect to see in the event input.
  - Possible values are `ATTRIBUTES_CHANGED` and `ENTITLEMENTS_ADDED`.
  - The above example lists both change types since both attributes and entitlements were added.  If an event payload only contains attributes added, then this list will only contain the `ATTRIBUTES_CHANGED` value.  This can be useful when filtering events based on change types, or quickly checking what types of objects changed in the account before continuing to process the input.
- `multiValueAttributeChanges` List of multivalued attributes that were aggregated with the account.  Only `addedValues` will appear for account created events.
- `account` The details of the account as it appears in IdentityNow.  This information can be used to query the account API for more information.
