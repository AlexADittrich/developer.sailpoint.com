## Event Context

![Flow](./img/identity-deleted-path.png)

Identity deleted events occur when an identity's associated account is deleted from the identity's authoritative source. After accounts are aggregated and the identity refresh process finds an identity that is not correlated to an account, the associated identity is deleted from IdentityNow. For more information, see [Configuring Correlation](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/Connectors/Configuring-Correlation/ta-p/74045). The Identity deleted event contains any identity attributes as they are configured in the identity profile. For more information, see [Mapping Identity Profiles](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/Admin-Help/Mapping-Identity-Profiles/ta-p/77877).

This event trigger provides a flexible way to extend joiner-mover-leaver processes. This provides more proactive governance and ensures users can quickly get necessary access when they enter your organization.

Some uses cases for this trigger include the following:

- Notify an administrator or system to take the appropriate provisioning actions as part of the leaver workflow.
- Notify a system to trigger another action (e.g. deactivate an employeeâ€™s badge upon termination).

This is an example input from this trigger:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "type": "IDENTITY",
    "id": "2c91808568c529c60168cca6f90c1313",
    "name": "William Wilson"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "firstname": "John"
  }
}
```
