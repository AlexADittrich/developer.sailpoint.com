# BuildMap Rule

## Overview

This rule manipulates raw input data provided by the rows and columns in a file and builds a map from the incoming data.

:::info
This rule runs in the cloud, however it is truly a connector rule as it executes against the DelimitedFileConnector.
:::

## Execution

- **Cloud Execution** - This rule executes in the IdentityNow cloud, and it has read-only access to IdentityNow data models, but it does not have access to on-premise sources or connectors.
- **Logging** - Logging statements are currently only visible to SailPoint personnel.
