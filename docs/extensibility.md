## Overview
The Identity Security Cloud (ISC) platform is designed for extensibility, which means that it's designed to allow the addition of new capabilities or functionalities. In addition to the APIs, SailPoint provides a number of extensibility options you can use to build custom solutions and integrations that meet your organization's needs. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
