  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **target**: *eq, sw*  **rights**: *ca*  Supported composite operators: *and, or*  All field values (second filter operands) are case-insensitive for this API.  Only a single *and* or *or* composite filter operator may be used. It must also be used between a target filter and a rights filter, not between 2 filters for the same field.  For example, the following is valid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+target+eq+%22SYS.OBJAUTH2%22`  The following is invalid: 1?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+rights+ca+(%SELECT%22)1

  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
