## Overview

The SailPoint Developer Relations Team has built some useful tools that improve the experience for developers building on the Identity Security Cloud (ISC) platform. These tools make it easier for developers to leverage the ISC APIs, extensibility options, and connectivity.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

<!-- ## CLI

The SailPoint command line interface (CLI) is a terminal-based tool you can use to interact with your ISC tenant. The CLI provides a text-based environment you can use to run operations known as "commands" to interact with your tenant however you want. You can use the CLI to perform many functions you would have otherwise used Postman or custom scripts to perform before. To learn more about the SailPoint CLI, refer to [CLI](./tools/cli).

## SDK

The SailPoint software development kits (SDKs) make it easier for developers to leverage the ISC APIs, extensibility options, and connectivity while they build with their preferred coding languages. To see the available SDK language options and find more information about those SDKs, refer to [SDK](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/tools/sdk).

## Rule Development Kit

The SailPoint rule development kit (RDK) is a project that makes rule development much easier. The RDK provides you with the available classes and methods when you're developing a rule. With the RDK, you can mock out these classes and run your rule locally to test your logic before submitting it for review. To learn more about the RDK, refer to [RDK](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/tools/rdk).

## UI Development Kit

The SailPoint ISC UI development kit provides developers with a way to quickly develop custom UIs that integrate with ISC. To learn more about the UI development kit, refer to [UI Development Kit](https://developer.sailpoint/tools/ui-development-kit).

## Admin Console

The ISC admin console is a desktop application you can use to administer and troubleshoot ISC. The admin console provides a single place you can use to perform common administrative tasks and troubleshoot issues in your ISC tenant. To learn more about the ISC admin console, refer to [Admin Console](https://developer.sailpoint/docs/tools/admin-console). -->
