## Overview

Connectivity refers to Identity Security Cloud's (ISC) ability to connect to many different [sources](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html) of many different types. Organizations can then manage access to the different sources and ensure that the access is secure.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
