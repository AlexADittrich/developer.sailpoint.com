Use this API to implement access request identity metrics functionality.
With this functionality in place, access request reviewers can see relevant details about the requested access item and associated source activity. 
This allows reviewers to see how many of the identities who share a manager with the access requester have this same type of access and how many of them have had activity in the related source. 
This additional context about whether the access has been granted before and how often it has been used can help those approving access requests make more informed decisions.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
