Use this API to implement the certification campaign filter functionality. These filters can be used to create a certification campaign that includes a subset of your entitlements or users to certify.

For example, if for a certification campaign an organization wants to certify only specific users or entitlements, then those can be included/excluded on the basis of campaign filters.

For more information about creating a campaign filter, refer to [Creating a Campaign Filter](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/certs/campaign_filters.html#creating-a-campaign-filter)

You can create campaign filters using any of the following criteria types:

- Access Profile : This criteria type includes or excludes access profiles from a campaign.

- Account Attribute : This criteria type includes or excludes certification items that match a specified value in an account attribute.

- Entitlement : This criteria type includes or excludes entitlements from a campaign.

- Identity : This criteria type includes or excludes specific identities from your campaign.

- Identity Attribute : This criteria type includes or excludes identities based on whether they have an identity attribute that matches criteria you've chosen.

- Role : This criteria type includes or excludes roles, as opposed to identities.

- Source : This criteria type includes or excludes entitlements from a source you select.

For more information about these criteria types, refer to [Types of Campaign Filters](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/certs/campaign_filters.html#types-of-campaign-filters)

Once the campaign filter is created, it can be linked while creating the campaign. The generated campaign will have the items to review as per the campaign filter.

For example, An inclusion campaign filter is created with a source of Source 1, an operation of Equals, and an entitlement of Entitlement 1. When this filter is selected, only users who have Entitlement 1 are included in the campaign, and only Entitlement 1 is shown in the certification.
