Use this API to implement user authentication system functionality. 
With this functionality in place, users can get a user's authentication system details, including their capabilities, and modify those capabilities. 
The user's capabilities refer to their access to different systems, or authorization, within the tenant, like access to certifications (CERT_ADMIN) or reports (REPORT_ADMIN). 
These capabilities also determine a user's access to the different APIs. 
This API provides users with a way to determine a user's access and make quick and easy changes to that access.
