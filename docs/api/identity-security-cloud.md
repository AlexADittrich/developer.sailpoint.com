## Overview

The Identity Security Cloud (ISC) APIs provide developers with a way to interact with the ISC platform and extend it. Developers can leverage these APIs to customize their platform experiences and build new solutions and integrations that meet their needs.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
