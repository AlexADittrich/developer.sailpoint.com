These specific solutions may either not fall into one of the extensibility, connectivity, tools, or reporting categories, or they may fall into multiple categories. Read these guides to learn how to implement these specific solutions. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
