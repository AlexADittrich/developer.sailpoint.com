## Overview

Data reporting refers to the process of collecting and presenting data in a structured format that makes the data accessible and easy to understand, which facilitates an organization's data-driven decisions. Identity Security Cloud (ISC) provides different data reporting options you can use to extract data from your tenant and make it presentable.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
