## Overview

Data reporting refers to the process of collecting and presenting data in a structured format that makes the data accessible and easy to understand, which facilitates an organization's data-driven decisions. Identity Security Cloud (ISC) provides different data reporting options you can use to extract data from your tenant and make it presentable.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

## Discuss

The most valuable resource for ISC developers is the SailPoint Developer Community itself, where ISC users and experts all over the world come together to ask questions and provide solutions.

To learn more about ISC data reporting and discuss the different options with SailPoint Developer Community members, go to the [SailPoint Developer Community Forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss/c/isc/6).
