## Overview
Configuration Management provides you with a form of version control for your tenant configurations. 
With Configuration Management, you can export snapshots of your current tenant configurations, downloading them in a JSON. 
These configurations can serve as different versions of your tenant configuration. 
You can then import those configurations into tenants to update, resore, or migrate tenant configurations. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
