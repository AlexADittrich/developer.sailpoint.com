Secure Data Share (SDS) makes your SailPoint identity data available directly in your own AWS Snowflake account. The provided dataset is comprised of structured tables that include identity, audit events, entitlements, roles, access profiles, accounts, and application data. SDS is an alternative to [search](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/search/index.html) that gives you direct access to your tenant data, allowing you to connect your favorite data analytics tools, like PowerBI and Tableau. For information on how to use SDS in your environment, see the documentation [here](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/secure_data_share/secure_data_share.html). For the entity relationship (ER) diagrams that represent the data model, please see the following pages.
